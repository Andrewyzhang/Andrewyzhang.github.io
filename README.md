## Welcome to Andrew's website! 

I'm currently a seventeen-year-old high school student at Acton-Boxborough Regional High School. I am rather passionate about school. I have both of my parents that support me, and an awesome older brother that guides me. My main hobbies are tennis and violin, but I also enjoy a handful of video games, going biking, traveling, skiing, and ice skating. I've been in Massachusetts my entire life, being born in Boston, then living in Newton until I was thirteen. I'm rather new to the world of programming and coding, but I look forward to delving into it more!
