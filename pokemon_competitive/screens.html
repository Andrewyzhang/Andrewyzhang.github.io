                <p class="backgroundinfo">
                The majority of the best hazard setters can also function as defensive tanks, like Ferrothorn. With its giant bulk in both Defense and Sp. Defense, along with its many resistances and few weaknesses, it makes a powerful start on many teams to set up mainly Stealth Rocks. It should hold a Rocky Helmet to increase recoil of contact moves along with its Iron Barbs ability. It should be Impish or Careful, or Relaxed or Sassy to decrease Speed, and EVs should only exclude Sp. Attack and Speed.

                <tr>
                    <td>Move 1: Gyro Ball</td>
                    <td>Move 2: Power Whip</td>
                    </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Move 3: Stealth Rock</td>
                    <td>Move 4: Knock Off/Payback/Leech Seed/Spikes</td>
                    </tr>
                
                <p class="moveswhy">
                Again, the purpose of this moveset is to set up hazards, not necessarily deal damage. Gyro Ball is very effective because Ferrotorn has already low Speed. Power Whip is for STAB. The last move has more freedom: Knock Off to get rid of items, Payback for coverage and utilizing its slow Speed, Leech Seed to also function as a wall, and Spikes to apply additional hazards.

                <img src="sprites_stats/250px-227Skarmory.png" class="ninjask">
                    
                <p class="backgroundinfo">
                Skarmory is also a popular choice, and it can function as a physical tank too. It is a reliable hazard setter because with its ability Sturdy, it is guaranteed to have Rocks set up. Much like Ferrothorn, it resists many types and only has two weaknesses. Skarmory should be Impish to boost its Defense more, and the raised in EVs to boost it even further. Some should be invested into Attack, so another angle is possible once the rocks are set. The item can vary, from a Sharp Beak to boost Skarmory's moves, or a Rocky Helmet to inflict more damage.

                    <td>Move 1: Brave Bird/Drill Peck</td>

                    </tr>
                
                <p class="moveswhy">
                This is a standard moveset for a hazard setter. Brave Bird should be chosen over Drill Peck because the recoil damage can be recovered by Roost. The last move is also very flexible. Iron Head can be used as another STAB, Whirlwind can force your opponent to swap, and Spikes adds more hazards on you opponent's side of the field.

                <p class="backgroundinfo">
                Klefki is another hazard setting Steel type with two weaknesses, but it has the most resistances out of the three. Klefki is best for setting up screens because of its ability, Prankster, allowing its status moves to have +1 priority. With the priority, the screens can be set up to cover Klefki's relatively lower defenses. Its nature can decrease either Attack or Sp. Attack to raise defenses, and EVs should be invested into defensive stats. The item should be Light Clay to increase the duration of the screens.

                <tr>
                    <td>Move 1: Foul Play</td>
                    <td>Move 2: Thunder Wave/Swagger</td>
                    </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Move 3: Reflect</td>
                    <td>Move 4: Light Screen</td>
                    </tr>
                
                <p class="moveswhy">
                Foul Play is Klefki's best offensive move because its power relies on the opponent's Attack stat rather than Klefki's. This works especially since Kefki has weak offense. The screens have to take up two move slots. The last move should be a status move as well to utilize Prankster. Thunder Wave can be used to cut the foe's Speed. Swagger can raise your opponent's Attack so Foul Play does more damage, along with the chance of confusion.
