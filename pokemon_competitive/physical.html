                <p class="backgroundinfo">Mega Salamence can function as both a physical and special sweeper, but its attack is slightly higher than its special. It is a good sweeper because not only are its base stats high, it can be boosted further with Dragon Dance, along with the Aerilate ability. Although it is a Mega, Mega Salamence can become a powerful sweeper with the right moves and investments. For physical sweepers, IVs should only exculde Special Attack, and EVs should be invested in Attack and Speed.  </p>

                <p class="moveswhy">
                    This moveset is best for sweeping because of the STAB (Same-Type Attack Boost) and the coverage. With Aerilate, Normal-Type moves become Flying type, and gain a 30% boost along with STAB. Although Salamence can learn Dragon Rush, Outrage or Dragon Claw is preferred due to its accuracy. Dragon Dance is obviously to boost the Attack and Speed stat. The fourth move should revolve around covering Steel types, since it resists both Dragon and Flying. Although Earthquake is super effective, it cannot hit Steel types with Levitate or is also Flying, and Crunch can do neutral damage.

                <p class="backgroundinfo">Talonflame is a very popular physical sweeper because of its signature ability, Gale Wings. With Gale Wings and its high Speed, its Brave Bird gains one priority, as well as its Roost, and it can outspeed foes also using priority.  Because of the priority, Talonflame must be Adamant, and invested in Attack. Speed should also be raised in case of the need to Swords Dance or Flare Blitz. The items can vary: Choice Band to power up and spam Brave Bird, Life Orb, or Sharp Beak. </p>

                <p class="moveswhy">
                    As previously mentioned, this is a very sweeping moveset, despite all the recoil. The recoil is worth the damage dealt, can can be recovered with Roost. Using Swords Dance should be timed very well, and should not be greedily spammed. The items should power up Brave Bird enough for the need to avoid it, especially since Talonflame's defenses is not the most reliable.

                <p class="backgroundinfo">
                Excadrill possesses high enough Attack to become a very effective physical sweeper, but its Speed is not the most reliable. The best way to improve Speed is by having a Jolly nature, but Adamant is acceptable as well. EVs should be invested the same way as the previous two, and the item can vary. Speed can be boosted by Choice Scarf, but items to buff Attack should be Choice Band or Life Orb. Another possibility is Air Balloon to cover the Ground weakness.

                <p class="moveswhy">
                    This moveset has very high coverage. Because of Excadrill's numerous resistances, it should be able to endure attacks long enough to strike back, if slower. The only reason Rapid Spin should be chosen over Swords Dance is for support, to remove any hazards on your side of the field.
