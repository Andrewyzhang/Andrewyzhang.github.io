        <h3><a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hello!</h3>
          
<p> I'm currently a seventeen-year-old high school student at Acton-Boxborough Regional High School. I am rather passionate about school. I have both of my parents that support me, and an awesome older brother that guides me. My main hobbies are tennis and violin, but I also enjoy a handful of video games, going biking, traveling, skiing, and ice skating. I've been in Massachusetts my entire life, being born in Boston, then living in Newton until I was thirteen. I'm rather new to the world of programming and coding, but I look forward to delving into it more!  </p>
   
<h3>School projects</h3>
<p> I first learned about making websites in a school elective. They were relatively goofy, but I keep them around anyway. 
<ul>
  <li><a href="ssb4_website_az/index.html">SSB4 Website</a></li>
  <li><a href="pokemon_competitive/index.html">Pokemon Website</a></li>
</ul>  
          
<h3>Extracurricular activities</h3>

<p>Outside of courses, I keep myself busy through a variety of activities. My biggest extracurricular time sink is music, which you can read more about below, and I also am a part of </p>

<h3>Music</h3>          
<p>I'm really passionate about orchestra, and I've played violin for 11 years. Every now and then I do some amateur recording for fun. </p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1dBg__wsuo">Mendelssohn Violin Concerto E Minor OP.64</a>(note: this isn't actually me)</li>
</ul>
