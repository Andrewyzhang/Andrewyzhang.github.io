                Blissey is one of the most powerful special tanks there is. Not only does it have the highest health in the game, its Sp. Defense is also significantly high. The fact that Fighting is its only weakness is also pretty nice. Many people raise Blissey's Defense in EVs and make it have a Bold Nature to try to raise its physical endurance. Blissey can also be raised in Health and Sp. Defense.

                <p class="moveswhy">
                This moveset is very standard for Blissey. Seismic Toss is very sigificant because it consistently deals the same amount of damage. Toxic is to help decrease the foe's health, and Soft-Boiled, Blissey's signature move, heals it very well. Flamethrower is for coverage of Steel types, since they cannot be poisoned. Counter is another more casual option rather than Flamethrower to help get rid of physical sweepers.

                <p class="backgroundinfo">
                Dragalge is a very good option to carry an Assault Vest, therefore act as a special tank. Its defensive stats are very good, and carry Dragalge very well. EVs should be invested in Sp. Defense, and then evenly among HP and Sp. Attack. If Assault Vest is not chosen, Black Sludge is another option. Adaptability is the best option for its ability.

                    </tr>
                
                <p class="moveswhy">
                Dragalge's movepool is rather vast, making it cover the majority of types. Sludge Bomb and Sludge Wave are pretty much equal, Sludge Wave with a bit more power but hitting all in Doubles or Triples. That is for STAB, as for Dragon Pulse as well. Hydro Pump and Scald is good coverage, Hydro Pump for power, Scald for accuracy and burn. The last move is purely for coverage.

                <p class="backgroundinfo">
                Togekiss is also a strong option because not only does its Sp. Defense have enough to stop many sweepers, but it also has reliable Sp. Attack to inflict effective damage back. Togekiss needs its ability Serene Grace to help boost the flinch of Air Slash, and Leftovers should be held as well to regain more health. Calm is its best nature, and EVs should be invested in Sp. Defense, HP, and either Sp. Attack or Speed.

                <p class="moveswhy">
                This is the popular Paraflinch moveset, which is basically paralyzing your opponenet to lower their Speed, and then spamming Air Slash, which gives a 60% chance to flinch with Serene Grace, along with the 30% chance to be fully paralyzed. Whenever opponents do manage to deal damage, it's simple to heal back up with Roost. Aura Sphere is purely for coverage, namely against Steel and Rock types.
