          <h3>My Work</h3>
          <p>
            At Tufts University, my primary major is computer science. I've
            mainly coded in C/C++ and Python, but I also learned a lot of
            frontend development with HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and React.
          </p>
          <p>
            For summer 2020, I got the opportunity to work for Beacons.ai, a
            startup targeted towards Instagram influencers. I contributed
            towards data analysis and full-stack work, and published a blog post
            for their website!

          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            I am a junior at Tufts studying CS and math with a minor in music. I
            was born in Boston and grew up in Newton, MA, but attended high
            school at Acton-Boxborough Regional High School. Growing up, my
            greatest passion is playing the violin/viola. Some of my other
            hobbies include tennis, hiking, traveling, skiing, ice skating, and
            playing video games. Academically, I've always loved math, and I
            started computer science at university. As I learn more within this
            field, I get more excited to create new projects!
          </p>

          <!-- <p>
            A little bit more about violin and tennis, the two activities I've
            kept up with for the majority of my childhood:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Music! As a young first grader who had no concept of free will, I
              was granted the chance to play a fancy wooden box with horsehair
              on a stick. From that faithful moment, I would call myself a
              violinist. While solo performances scare me stiff, the communities
              I found in orchestras and chamber groups foster my love for
              classical repertoire. Junior year of high school, I taught myself
              viola, which exposed me to a whole new perspective in ensemble
              music (and also viola jokes).
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Tennis! Something that my entire family participates in. Alongside
              ice hockey and swimming, it has kept me active on my feet and has
              been a stress reliever throughout my academic years. My Saturday
              mornings have been defined by heading out to the courts and
              playing friendly matches with family and friends, and the
              community that formed around me from that shared passion is one I
              will always cherish.

          <h3>Previous Websites</h3>
          <p>
            I first coded in HTML/CSS in high school, and I designed two
            websites. My very first one was about Super Smash Bros 4, Nintendo's
            combat-style crossover game. This site gives an overview of how to
            play the game. Another Nintendo franchise I love is Pokemon, and my
            second website gives insight on the competitive aspect of it. I'm
            pround to present these as the first two websites I've used my
            personal creativity to build.

          <h3>Music</h3>
          <p>
            In a chamber music program, I got the opportunity to perform the
            Mendelssohn Octet in Eb major at Gables in Winchester, a senior
            community home. Playing viola in the 1st movement and violin in the
            second, here's are the first two movements of Mendelssohn's Octet:
