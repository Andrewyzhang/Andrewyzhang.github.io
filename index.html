        <h3><a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Uh... Thanks for taking the time to learn about me... ^.^</h3>
          
<p> I'm currently a seventeen-year-old high school student at Acton-Boxborough Regional High School. High school has been amazing with the friends I have to catch me when I fall, and the teachers to encourage following what I'm passionate about. I have both of my parents that do their jobs perfectly, and an awesome older brother that stops me from making stupid mistakes. My main hobbies are tennis and violin, and I also enjoy video games, biking, traveling, skiing, and ice skating. I've been in Massachusetts my entire life, being born in Boston, then living in Newton until I was thirteen. I'm rather new to the world of programming and coding, but I look forward to delving into it more!  </p>
   
<h3>School projects</h3>
<p> I first learned about making websites in a school elective. They were my class projects I goofed around with, but I keep them around anyway for nostalgia. So here's some information about two video game series I personally enjoy!
<ul>
  <li><a href="ssb4_website_az/index.html">SSB4 Website</a></li>
  <li><a href="pokemon_competitive/index.html">Pokemon Website</a></li>
</ul>  
          
<h3>Extracurricular activities</h3>

        <p>Outside of academic courses, I keep myself busy through a variety of activities. One word that influences my life the most: strings. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Music! Music music music music music. Violin has been the biggest influence of my life, and I'm so happy I can play it with a community that loves string instruments as much as I do. Orchestra, chamber music, even solo practicing; you can jsut make music and feel happy. </li>
          <li>Tennis. It has strings across its head. And I use them to whack a fuzzy neon ball around on a concrete court. Fun stuff, y'know? Tennis allows me to not be lazy as a couch potato and feel like I'm social when I play with friends. It's been my stress and nutritional reliever for a s long as I can remember, and playing with the rest of my family has been one of the greatest blessings ever. </li>
        </ul>
        
        
<h3>Music</h3>          
<p>I've been playing a fancy wooden box for 11 years now. Dang. It's funny how I feel like I haven't improved. I always thought of myself as the most masterful violin player to ever exist, as proven by the staggered squeaks of my six-year-old playing. While my brother winced every time I budged the bow, I was just hearing the music buried deep, deep, deep, deep in my squawks. Man I love violin. </p>
