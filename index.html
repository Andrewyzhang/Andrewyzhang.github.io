        <h3><a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hey there! Check this out!</h3>
          
<p> I am currently a nineteen-year-old sophomore at Tufts University studying under computer science and applied mathematics, with a minor in music. I grew up in Newton, MA, but attended high school at Acton-Boxborough Regional High School. I'm very passionate about violin, playing classical repertoire with chamber groups and orchestras. Some of my other passions include tennis, video games, biking, traveling, skiing, and ice skating. As I learn more throughout college, I hope to build more projects and expand my knowledge of computer science! </p>
   
<h3>School projects</h3>
<p> Back in high school, I briefly learned some HTML/CSS and created two personal websites. The first on is about Super Smash Bros 4, one of the best crossover games under Nintendo. This project gives an overview of how to play the game. Another Nintendo franchise I love is Pokemon, and my second website gives insight on the competitive aspect of it. I'm pround to present these as the first two websites I've used my personal creativity to build. </p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="ssb4_website_az/index.html">SSB4 Website</a></li>
  <li><a href="pokemon_competitive/index.html">Pokemon Website</a></li>
</ul>  
          
<h3>Extracurricular activities</h3>

        <p>Outside of academic courses, I keep myself busy through a variety of activities. One word that influences my life the most: strings. </p>
        <ul>
          <li> Music! I grew up playing violin, and I'm so happy I can play it with a community that loves string instruments as much as I do. Orchestra, chamber music, even solo practicing; you can just express so much emotion through lines of notes. On the road, I taught myself viola to expand my repertoire. Viola exposed me to a whole new perspective in ensemble music, and the versatility betweeen the two instruments have been an invaluable experience! </li>
          <li>Tennis. This is an activity I grew up with alongside my entire family. It has kept me active and relieved stressed throughout my academic years, and playing with the rest of my family has been one of the greatest blessings ever.  </li>
        </ul>
        
        
<h3>Music</h3>          
<p> In a chamber music program, I got the opportunity to perform the Mendelssohn Octet in Eb major at Gables in Winchester, a senior community home. Playing viola in the 1st movement and violin in the second, here's are the first two movements of Mendelssohn's Octet: </p>
