        <h3><a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hey there! Check this out!</h3>
          
<p> I'm currently a seventeen-year-old high school student at Acton-Boxborough Regional High School. High school has been amazing with the friends I have to catch me when I fall, and the teachers to encourage following what I'm passionate about. I have both of my parents that do their jobs perfectly, and an awesome older brother that stops me from making stupid mistakes. My main hobbies are tennis and violin, and I also enjoy video games, biking, traveling, skiing, and ice skating. I've been in Massachusetts my entire life, being born in Boston, then living in Newton until I was thirteen. I'm rather new to the world of programming and coding, but I look forward to delving into it more!  </p>
   
<h3>School projects</h3>
<p> I first learned about making websites in a school elective. They were my class projects I goofed around with, but I keep them around anyway for nostalgia. So here's some information about two video game series I personally enjoy!
<ul>
  <li><a href="ssb4_website_az/index.html">SSB4 Website</a></li>
  <li><a href="pokemon_competitive/index.html">Pokemon Website</a></li>
</ul>  
          
<h3>Extracurricular activities</h3>

        <p>Outside of academic courses, I keep myself busy through a variety of activities. One word that influences my life the most: strings. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Music! Violin has been the biggest influence of my life, and I'm so happy I can play it with a community that loves string instruments as much as I do. Orchestra, chamber music, even solo practicing; you can just make music and feel happy. I've recently extended my playing to viola, and I'm so glad I took that opportunity. Viola exposed me to a whole new perspective in group music, and switching betweeen the two instruments has been a blast!</li>
          <li>Tennis. It has strings across its head. And I use them to whack a fuzzy neon ball around on a concrete court. Fun stuff, y'know? Tennis allows me to not be lazy as a couch potato and have some competition with friends. It's been my stress and health reliever for as long as I can remember, and playing with the rest of my family has been one of the greatest blessings ever. </li>
        </ul>
        
        
<h3>Music</h3>          
<p>Music is powerful. It's amazing what it can accomplish, and it's a chance to allow myself to share my passion with everyone else. My group got the opportunity to play at Gables in Winchester to provide music for our community. Playing both viola and violin, here's the first two movements of Mendelssohn's Octet: </p>
