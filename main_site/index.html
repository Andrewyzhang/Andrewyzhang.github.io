        <h2><a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to my website!</h2>
          
<p> Hello! I am currently a nineteen-year-old sophomore at Tufts University studying under computer science and applied mathematics, with a minor in music. I grew up in Newton, MA, but attended high school at Acton-Boxborough Regional High School. I'm very passionate about violin, playing classical repertoire with chamber groups and orchestras. Some of my other passions include tennis, video games, biking, traveling, skiing, and ice skating. As I learn more throughout college, I hope to build more projects and expand my knowledge of computer science! </p>
   
<h3>School projects</h3>
<p> Back in high school, I briefly learned some HTML/CSS and created two personal websites. The first on is about Super Smash Bros 4, one of the best crossover games under Nintendo. This project gives an overview of how to play the game. Another Nintendo franchise I love is Pokemon, and my second website gives insight on the competitive aspect of it. I'm pround to present these as the first two websites I've used my personal creativity to build. </p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="ssb4_website_az/index.html">SSB4 Website</a></li>
  <li><a href="pokemon_competitive/index.html">Pokemon Website</a></li>
</ul>  
          
<h3>Extracurricular activities</h3>

        <p>Outside of academic courses, I keep myself busy through a variety of activities. One word that influences my life the most: strings. </p>
        <ul>
          <li> Music! As a young first grader who had no concept of free will, I was granted the chance to play a fancy wooden box with horsehair on a stick. From that faithful moment, I would call myself a violinist.  While solo performances scare me stiff, the community I found in orchestras and chamber groups foster my love for classical repertoire. On the road, I taught myself viola, which exposed me to a whole new perspective in ensemble music (and also viola jokes). </li>
          <li>Tennis! Something that my entire family participates in. Alongside ice hockey and swimming, it has kept me actively on my feet and has been a stress reliever throughout my academic years. My Saturday mornings have been defined by heading out to the courts and playing friendly matches with family and friends, and the community that formed around me from that shared passion is one I will always cherish.  </li>
        </ul>
        
        
<h3>Music</h3>          
<p> In a chamber music program, I got the opportunity to perform the Mendelssohn Octet in Eb major at Gables in Winchester, a senior community home. Playing viola in the 1st movement and violin in the second, here's are the first two movements of Mendelssohn's Octet: </p>
